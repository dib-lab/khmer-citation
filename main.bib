@article{Chikhi:2014aa,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome assembly tools based on the de Bruijn graph framework rely on a parameter k, which represents a trade-off between several competing effects that are difficult to quantify. There is currently a lack of tools that would automatically estimate the best k to use and/or quickly generate histograms of k-mer abundances that would allow the user to make an informed decision.
RESULTS: We develop a fast and accurate sampling method that constructs approximate abundance histograms with several orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional methods. We then present a fast heuristic that uses the generated abundance histograms for putative k values to estimate the best possible value of k. We test the effectiveness of our tool using diverse sequencing datasets and find that its choice of k leads to some of the best assemblies.

	Abstract = {We present Quip, a lossless compression algorithm for next-generation sequencing data in the FASTQ and SAM/BAM formats. In addition to implementing reference-based compression, we have developed, to our knowledge, the first assembly-based compressor, using a novel de novo assembly algorithm. A probabilistic data structure is used to dramatically reduce the memory required by traditional de Bruijn graph assemblers, allowing millions of reads to be assembled very efficiently. Read sequences are then stored as positions within the assembled contigs. This is combined with statistical compression of read identifiers, quality scores, alignment information and sequences, effectively collapsing very large data sets to <15% of their original size with no loss of information.

  counting of k-mers in sequencing data sets. Unlike previous methods based on
  data structures such as hash tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer
  relies entirely on a simple probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch.
  The Count-Min Sketch permits online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in
  memory which is necessary to support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On
  sparse data sets this data structure is considerably more memory efficient than
  any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces
  a systematic overcount for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the
  k-mers, are stored. Here we analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the
  miscount rate of khmer for generating k-mer frequency distributions and
  retrieving k-mer counts for individual k-mers. We also compare the performance
  of khmer to several other k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer,
  Jellyfish, BFCounter, DSK, KMC, Turtle and KAnalyze. Finally, we examine the
  effectiveness of profiling sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and
  digital normalization of reads in the context of high khmer false positive
  rates. khmer is implemented in C++ wrapped in a Python interface, offers a
  tested and robust API, and is freely available under the BSD license at

	Abstract = {The large volumes of sequencing data required to sample deeply the microbial communities of complex environments pose new challenges to sequence analysis. De novo metagenomic assembly effectively reduces the total amount of data to be analyzed but requires substantial computational resources. We combine two preassembly filtering approaches-digital normalization and partitioning-to generate previously intractable large metagenome assemblies. Using a human-gut mock community dataset, we demonstrate that these methods result in assemblies nearly identical to assemblies from unprocessed data. We then assemble two large soil metagenomes totaling 398 billion bp (equivalent to 88,000 Escherichia coli genomes) from matched Iowa corn and native prairie soils. The resulting assembled contigs could be used to identify molecular interactions and reaction networks of known metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthology database. Nonetheless, more than 60% of predicted proteins in assemblies could not be annotated against known databases. Many of these unknown proteins were abundant in both corn and prairie soils, highlighting the benefits of assembly for the discovery and characterization of novelty in soil biodiversity. Moreover, 80% of the sequencing data could not be assembled because of low coverage, suggesting that considerably more sequencing data are needed to characterize the functional content of soil.},
