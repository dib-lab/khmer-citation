\begin{abstract}

The khmer package is a freely available software library for working efficiently with fixed length DNA words, or k-mers.  khmer provides implementations of a probabilistic k-mer counting data structure, a compressible De Bruijn graph representation, De Bruijn graph
partitioning, and digital normalization.  khmer is implemented in C++ and Python, and is freely available under the BSD license at http://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/.

\section*{Introduction}

The introduction provides context as to why the software tool was developed and what need it addresses.  It is good scholarly practice to mention previously developed tools that address similar needs, and why the current tool is needed. 

DNA words of a fixed-length k, or ``k-mer'', are a common abstraction
in DNA sequence analysis that enable alignment-free sequence analysis
and comparison. With the advent of second-generation
sequencing and the widespread adoption of De Bruijn graph-based
assemblers, k-mers became even more widely used.  However, the
dramatically increased rate of sequence data generation from the Roche
454 and the Solexa/Illumina sequencers has challenged the basic
data structures and algorithms for k-mer storage and manipulation.
This has led to the development of a wide range of data structures and
algorithms that explore possible improvements to k-mer-based
approaches.

Here we present version 1.4 of the khmer software package, a
high-performance library implementing memory- and time-efficient
algorithms for the manipulation and analysis of short-read data sets.  khmer
contains reference implementations of several approaches, including a
probabilistic k-mer counter based on the CountMin Sketch \cite{Zhang2013}, a
compressible De Bruijn graph representation built on top of Bloom
filters \cite{Pell2012}, and a streaming lossy compression approach for
short-read data sets termed ``digital normalization'' \cite{Brown2012}.

khmer is both research software and a software product for users: it
has been used in the development of novel data structures and
algorithms, and it is also immediately useful for certain kinds of
data analysis (discussed below).  We are continuing to develop research
extensions while maintaining existing functionality.

The khmer software consists of a core library implemented in C++, a
CPython library wrapper implemented in C, and a set of Python
``driver'' scripts that make use of the library to perform various
sequence analysis tasks.  The software is currently developed on
GitHub under github.com/dib-lab/, and it is released under the BSD
License.  There is greater than 80\% statement coverage under
automated tests, measured on both C++ and Python code but primarily
executed at the Python level.

\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{Implementation}
For software tool papers, this section should address how the tool works and any relevant technical details required for implementation of the tool by other developers.  

The core data structures and traversal code are implemented in C++, and
then wrapped for Python in hand-written C code, for a total of
12.2k lines of C/C++ code.  The command-line API and all of the tests
are written in 6.6k lines of Python code.

Documentation is written in reStructuredText, compiled with Sphinx, and hosted on ReadTheDocs.org.

\subsection*{Operation}
This part of the methods should include the minimal system requirements needed to run the software and an overview of the workflow for the tool for users of the tool.

\section*{Features}

khmer has several complementary feature sets, all centered on short-read
manipulation and filtering.

\subsection*{k-mer counting and read trimming}

Using a memory-efficient CountMin Sketch approach, khmer provides an
interface for online counting of k-mers in streams of reads.  The
basic functionality includes calculating the k-mer frequency spectra
in sequence data sets and trimming reads at low-abundance k-mers.
This functionality is explored in \cite{Zhang2013}.

\subsection*{De Bruijn graph representation and exploration}

We have also built a De Bruijn graph representation on top of a Bloom
filter, and implemented this in khmer.  The primary use for this so
far has been to enable memory efficient {\em graph partitioning}, in
which reads contributing to disconnected subgraphs are subdivided into
different files.  This can lead to an approximately 20-fold decrease
in the amount of memory needed for metagenome assembly
\cite{Pell2012}, and may also separate reads into species-specific
bins \cite{Howe2012}.

\subsection*{Digital normalization}

We have implemented a streaming ``lossy compression'' algorithm in
khmer.  This ``digital normalization'' algorithm eliminates redundant
short reads while retaining sufficient information to generate a
contig assembly \cite{Brown2012}.  The algorithm takes advantage of the online
k-mer counting functionaliy in khmer to estimate per-read coverage as
reads are examined; reads can then be accepted as novel or rejected as
redundant. This functions as a kind of error correction, because the
net effect is to decrease not only the total number of reads considered
for assembly, but also decreases the total number of errors considered
by the assembler.
